```csharp
I2cConnectionSettings settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(1, Max44009.DefaultI2cAddress);
I2cDevice device = I2cDevice.Create(settings);

// integration time is 100ms
using (Max44009 sensor = new Max44009(device, IntegrationTime.Time100))
{
    while (true)
    {
        // read illuminance
        Console.WriteLine($"Illuminance: {sensor.Illuminance}Lux");
        Console.WriteLine();

        Thread.Sleep(1000);
    }
}
